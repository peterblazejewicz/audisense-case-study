# Identified Project Context

The project is company internal application that supports internal processes, including data gathering, data submissions with validation, and data reports with complex charts. It is currently implemented as a desktop WPF application and is scheduled to be rewritten as a web-based application.

Current Tech Stack:
1. Backend:
   - REST API
   - Hosted on Azure infrastructure
   - Built with .NET technologies

2. Frontend:
   - Desktop application using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)

3. Development Team:
   - Proficient in .NET development
   - Experienced in WPF for building user interfaces
   - Limited professional web development experience

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Application Migration**
    - Successfully migrate the existing WPF desktop application to a web-based solution
    - Ensure 100% feature parity with the current application
    - Maintain existing backend REST API integration
    - Preserve current data gathering, submission, and validation capabilities
    - Retain complex chart reporting functionality

2. **Team Development**
    - Upskill the development team in web development technologies
    - Ensure smooth transition from WPF to web development practices
    - Align team's technical capabilities with company-wide development standards
    - Establish web development best practices within the team

### Key Success Criteria
- Zero loss of existing business functionality during migration
- Maintained or improved application performance metrics
- Web application accessibility from any modern browser
- Reduced deployment and maintenance overhead compared to the existing desktop solution
- Measurable improvement in team's web development competencies

### Additional Benefits
- Improved user accessibility (no local installation required)
- Simplified deployment process
- Enhanced cross-platform compatibility
- Easier integration with other web-based company solutions
- Reduced maintenance costs through centralized updates

### Constraints & Considerations
- Maintain the existing backend REST API architecture
- Leverage team's .NET expertise in the new technology stack
- Ensure a gradual learning curve for the development team
- Minimize disruption to end users during transition
