# User Experience Migration Strategy from WPF to Blazor WebAssembly

## Status
Proposed

## Context

Migrating from a desktop-based WPF application to a web-based Blazor WebAssembly application requires thoughtful consideration of user experience (UX) elements to ensure the transition maintains or enhances usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.

## Decision

### Key UX Transition Areas

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility**
   - **Preservation**: Ensure existing keyboard shortcuts are retained or appropriately adapted for the web.
   - **Enhancement**: Incorporate ARIA roles and attributes to ensure accessibility compliance.
   - **Consideration**: Provide alternative input methods for accessibility, like voice or screen readers.

2. **Responsive Layout and Window Management**
   - **Adaptation**: Transition from fixed window sizes to responsive web layouts supporting multiple device sizes.
   - **Utilization**: Use CSS Flexbox and Grid for dynamic resizing and layout adjustments.
   - **Consideration**: Implement breakpoints and media queries to optimize for different screen resolutions.

3. **File System Access Alternatives**
   - **Replacement**: Substitute desktop file handling with browser-compatible methods such as the File API and drag-and-drop.
   - **Security**: Ensure file access follows web security best practices, limiting exposure to only necessary data.

4. **Native Integrations and Notification Systems**
   - **Transition**: Move from system tray notifications to web-based alternatives like the Notifications API.
   - **Enhancement**: Leverage modern web capabilities like push notifications and service workers.
   - **Consideration**: Ensure fallback mechanisms for unsupported browsers or offline states.

5. **Mobile and Tablet Experience Design**
   - **Design**: Ensure the application is touch-friendly and adapts well to mobile and tablet interfaces.
   - **Interface**: Design adaptive user interfaces that scale efficiently across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
   - **Consideration**: Implement touch gestures and mobile-specific functionality to enhance user experience.

## Consequences

Transitioning from a desktop to a web application provides an opportunity to modernize the user experience by introducing responsive design, improving accessibility, and leveraging web technologies for broader device compatibility. However, it requires a careful redesign of UI components and workflows to align with web standards and user expectations.

The successful migration will lead to increased user satisfaction through improved accessibility, cross-device functionality, and modern user interactions, while also ensuring a smooth transition for existing users familiar with the desktop application.
