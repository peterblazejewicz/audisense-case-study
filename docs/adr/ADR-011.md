# ADR-011: Security Model Transition for WPF to Blazor WebAssembly Migration

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The migration from WPF desktop application to Blazor WebAssembly fundamentally changes the security landscape. Desktop applications operate within the Windows security context with direct file system access, integrated Windows authentication, and local data storage. Web applications operate within browser sandboxes, require explicit transport security, stateless authentication mechanisms, and browser-based storage with different security models.

This transition introduces new security challenges while potentially eliminating others. Understanding these differences is crucial for maintaining equivalent or enhanced security posture during migration without knowing the specific current authentication/authorization implementation.

## Decision

### Authentication and Authorization Model Transition

#### **Desktop Security Model Characteristics**
- **Persistent Sessions**: Authentication often tied to Windows user session lifecycle or application-managed persistence
- **Local User Context**: Potential direct access to Windows user profiles, registry, or local user databases
- **Network Trust**: Often operates within trusted corporate network boundaries or VPN connections
- **Single Device Context**: User identity typically bound to specific physical device or installation

#### **Web Security Model Requirements**
- **Cross-Origin Considerations**: Browser same-origin policy affects authentication flows and API access
- **Public Network Exposure**: Must assume operation over untrusted networks and public internet
- **Multi-Device Support**: User identity must work across different devices, browsers, and platforms

#### **Key Migration Challenges**
1. **Authentication Method Transition**: Moving from any current auth mechanism to web-compatible approaches
2. **Backwards Compatibility**: Potentially supporting both desktop and web authentication during transition

### Data Storage Security Model Transition

#### **Desktop Storage Characteristics**
- **File System Security**: May use Windows EFS, custom encryption, or rely on OS-level security
- **Access Control**: Potential use of Windows ACLs, user/group permissions, or application-level controls
- **Local Database**: Direct access to local database files with various security implementations
- **Backup and Recovery**: Traditional file backup, registry, or database backup mechanisms
- **Data Residency**: Full control over data location, persistence, and lifecycle

#### **Browser Storage Limitations and Considerations**
- **Storage APIs**: Limited to localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, and cache APIs
- **Storage Quotas**: Browser-imposed size limits that vary by browser, device, and user settings
- **Data Persistence**: No guarantee of persistence; data can be cleared by browser, user, or low storage
- **Cross-Tab Security**: Data potentially accessible across tabs within same origin
- **Incognito Mode**: Different behavior and limitations in private browsing modes
- **Browser Updates**: Storage behavior may change with browser updates

#### **Key Migration Challenges**
1. **Data Encryption Strategy**: Determining appropriate client-side encryption approaches for sensitive data
2. **Storage Partitioning**: Deciding what data to store locally vs. server-side vs. hybrid approaches
3. **Data Synchronization**: Handling conflicts between local cached data and server data
4. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensuring GDPR/CCPA compliance with browser data storage and retention
5. **Data Portability**: Enabling data export/import for user mobility between devices
6. **Storage Quota Management**: Gracefully handling storage limitations and cleanup strategies

### Network Security Model Transition

#### **Desktop Network Security Context**
- **Direct API Calls**: May operate within corporate network, VPN, or trusted network segments
- **OS-Level Protection**: Relies on Windows firewall, antivirus, or corporate network security
- **Certificate Handling**: Uses Windows certificate store and trust relationships
- **Network Authentication**: May leverage Windows authentication for network resources
- **Trust Boundaries**: Often operates within established organizational network trust boundaries

#### **Web Application Security Requirements**
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications must be encrypted in transit
- **CORS Policy**: Must explicitly define cross-origin resource sharing rules and restrictions
- **Same-Origin Policy**: Browser enforces restrictions on cross-origin requests and resource access
- **Content Security Policy**: Required to prevent XSS, injection attacks, and unauthorized resource loading
- **Certificate Management**: Must handle certificate validation, pinning, and trust establishment

#### **Key Migration Challenges**
1. **CORS Configuration**: Defining appropriate origins, methods, headers, and credentials handling
2. **API Authentication**: Implementing stateless authentication mechanisms for API access
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protecting APIs from abuse, DDoS attacks, and resource exhaustion
4. **Input Validation**: Ensuring robust server-side validation of all inputs and parameters

### Transport Security Considerations

#### **Desktop Security Context**
- **Local Network**: Often operates within corporate network with established security policies
- **Direct Connections**: May use direct TCP connections, named pipes, or other non-HTTP protocols

#### **Web Security Requirements**
- **HTTPS Mandatory**: All communication must be encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL
- **Security Headers**: Must implement comprehensive HTTP security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

#### **Key Migration Challenges**
1. **Security Header Strategy**: Implementing CSP, HSTS, HPKP, and other protective headers
2. **Mixed Content**: Ensuring all resources (scripts, styles, images) are served over HTTPS

### Session Management Model Transition

#### **Desktop Session Characteristics**
- **Persistent State**: Application state often persists until explicit logout or system shutdown
- **Single Session**: Typically one session per user per machine or application instance

#### **Web Session Requirements**
- **Explicit Session Management**: Application must actively manage session lifecycle and state
- **Stateless Design**: Sessions must be maintained through tokens, cookies, or similar mechanisms
- **Multi-Tab Considerations**: Handling authentication state consistency across browser tabs
- **Cross-Device Sessions**: Supporting multiple concurrent sessions across different devices

#### **Key Migration Challenges**
1. **Session Timeout Policies**: Defining appropriate idle timeout and absolute timeout values
2. **Cross-Tab Synchronization**: Maintaining consistent authentication state across browser tabs
3. **Offline Session Handling**: Managing authentication state when application works offline (PWA)

## Consequences

### Potential Security Improvements

**Modernized Security Architecture:**
- Transition to industry-standard web authentication protocols and practices
- Improved update security through web-based deployment and automatic updates
- Better isolation through browser sandbox environment
- Standardized security headers and mandatory transport encryption

**Operational Benefits:**
- Reduced client-side security maintenance burden
- Enhanced monitoring and threat detection capabilities
- Improved compliance with modern security standards and frameworks

### Security Challenges and Risks

**Technical Complexity:**
- Increased complexity in authentication and session management implementation
- Need for comprehensive understanding of web security principles and threats
- Browser-specific security behaviors, limitations, and compatibility issues
- Client-side storage security considerations and limitations

**Operational Risks:**
- Network connectivity requirements for security-critical functions
- Browser compatibility variations in security feature support

### Critical Risk Areas Requiring Attention

1. **Data Migration**: Potential data exposure, corruption, or loss during transition from local to web storage
2. **Session Security**: Risk of session fixation, hijacking, unauthorized access, or session management failures
3. **Client-Side Security**: XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, and other web-specific attack vectors
4. **API Security**: Unauthorized API access, data leakage, injection attacks, or service abuse

### Security Testing and Validation Requirements

**Pre-Migration Security Assessment:**
- Current desktop application security audit and threat modeling
- Identification of sensitive data, access patterns, and security controls
- Assessment of existing authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms
- Documentation of current security policies and compliance requirements

**Post-Migration Security Validation:**
