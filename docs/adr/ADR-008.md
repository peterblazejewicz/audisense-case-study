# IDE and Tooling Selection for Blazor WebAssembly Development

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Following the development environment setup in ADR-006, a comprehensive evaluation of IDE options is needed for optimal Blazor WebAssembly development. The evaluation covers .NET 9, C#, Blazor framework support, debugging capabilities, hot reload functionality, and cross-platform development requirements.

## Decision

### IDE Comparison

**Visual Studio 2022 (Windows):**
- ✅ Native Blazor project templates and scaffolding
- ✅ Superior debugging experience with breakpoints in .razor files
- ✅ Built-in hot reload for Blazor WebAssembly
- ✅ Excellent IntelliSense for Razor syntax
- ❌ Windows-only limitation

**Visual Studio Code (Cross-platform):**
- ✅ Cross-platform availability (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ C# Dev Kit extension provides good .NET support
- ✅ Lightweight and fast startup
- ⚠️ Limited debugging capabilities for Blazor components
- ⚠️ Hot reload requires manual configuration

**JetBrains Rider (Cross-platform):**
- ✅ Cross-platform with a consistent experience
- ✅ Advanced refactoring and code analysis
- ✅ Strong debugging support for .NET applications
- ⚠️ Blazor-specific tooling still maturing
- ❌ Limited hot reload support for Blazor

### Recommendation: Visual Studio 2022

**Primary IDE:** Visual Studio 2022 for Windows development
- Best-in-class Blazor WebAssembly tooling
- Native hot reload and debugging support
- Seamless integration with the existing project structure
- Optimal developer productivity for Blazor-specific tasks

**Secondary Option:** Visual Studio Code for cross-platform scenarios
- Use when team members require macOS/Linux development
- Configure with C# Dev Kit and Blazor extensions
- Accept reduced debugging capabilities as a trade-off

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
- Maximum development efficiency with Blazor-optimized tooling
- Reduced learning curve leveraging existing Visual Studio expertise
- Superior debugging and hot reload experience
- Native support for Blazor project templates and deployment

**Limitations:**
- Windows dependency for primary development environment
- Team members on other platforms need alternative setup
- Potential licensing considerations for enterprise scenarios

**Prerequisites:**
- Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.8+) with Blazor WebAssembly workload
- .NET 9 SDK installation
- Optional: Visual Studio Code setup for cross-platform team members
