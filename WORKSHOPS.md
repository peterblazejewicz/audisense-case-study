The workshops address the most problematic areas for desktop developers moving to web technologies while leveraging
their existing .NET expertise and highlighting the advantages of the shared technical stack.

## Workshop Topics

### 1. **Steve Sanderson's Blazor Vision: The Journey from Idea to Reality**

Exploring Steve Sanderson's groundbreaking 2017 NDC Oslo presentation that introduced Blazor to the world, understanding
the vision of running .NET in browsers, and how this revolutionary idea has evolved into a production-ready framework.

### 2. **Blazor Component Architecture vs WPF Controls**

Understanding the fundamental differences between WPF UserControls and Blazor components, including lifecycle
management, data binding patterns, and reusability concepts.

### 3. **Data Binding: From WPF MVVM to Blazor**

Transitioning from WPF's two-way data binding and INotifyPropertyChanged to Blazor's parameter binding, event callbacks,
and state management patterns.

### 4. **JavaScript Interop Fundamentals**

Essential techniques for calling JavaScript functions from C# and vice versa, managing promises, and handling JavaScript
objects in Blazor applications.

### 5. **Understanding the Browser Event Loop**

How JavaScript's single-threaded event loop affects Blazor applications, async/await patterns in web context, and
preventing UI blocking operations.

### 6. **Web Browser Rendering Fundamentals**

Key concepts of how browsers render web pages: DOM structure, CSS application, and performance considerations for
building responsive applications.

### 7. **Modern CSS Layout with Flexbox**

Learning Flexbox for flexible, responsive layouts - a powerful alternative to WPF's StackPanel and DockPanel for
web-based applications.

### 8. **CSS Grid Layout Techniques**

Mastering CSS Grid for complex, two-dimensional layouts that rival WPF's Grid panel capabilities while being responsive
and web-optimized.

### 9. **Progressive Web Apps (PWA) with Blazor**

Converting Blazor applications into PWAs, implementing service workers, offline functionality, and creating native-like
app experiences.

### 10. **PWA Offline Data Management**

Strategies for caching data, handling offline scenarios, background sync, and maintaining application state without
network connectivity.

### 11. **Blazor Server vs Blazor WebAssembly**

Comparing hosting models, understanding when to use each approach, performance implications, and choosing the right
model for your application.

### 12. **Component Communication Patterns**

Moving from WPF's routed events and commands to Blazor's parameter passing, EventCallback patterns, and cascading
parameters for effective component interaction.

### 13. **CSS Integration and Scoped Styling**

Leveraging CSS in Blazor applications, component-scoped styling, CSS isolation, and creating maintainable styles that
work well with component architecture.

### 14. **Form Handling and Validation in Blazor**

Building robust forms with EditForm, validation attributes, custom validators, and creating user-friendly validation
experiences.

### 15. **Blazor Rendering and Component Lifecycle**

Understanding how Blazor's rendering engine works, component lifecycle methods, and optimization strategies for better
performance.

### 16. **State Management in Blazor Applications**

Implementing application-wide state management using dependency injection, custom services, and state containers for
complex applications.

### 17. **Navigation and Routing: From WPF Pages to Web Routes**

Transitioning from WPF's NavigationService and Page navigation to Blazor's routing system, URL-based navigation, and
browser history management.

### 18. **Browser APIs and Web Platform Features**

Accessing browser capabilities through JavaScript interop: geolocation, notifications, file handling, and other modern
web APIs.

### 19. **Debugging and Development Tools**

Tools and techniques for debugging Blazor applications, browser developer tools integration, and effective development
workflows.

### 20. **Performance Optimization in Blazor**

Identifying performance opportunities, optimizing component rendering, memory management, and lazy loading strategies
for web applications.
