# Migration of AudiSense WPF Application to Web Technologies using Blazor Web Framework and .NET 9

## Status

Proposed

## Context

- The AudiSense application currently runs as a desktop application using WPF and .NET 9.
- The need for migration arises from the desire to support remote collaboration and simplify software updates.
- The choice of web technologies like a Blazor web framework and .NET 9 aligns with the company's Microsoft-focused strategy and existing team skills.

## Decision

- The migration will transition the existing WPF application to a web-based solution using a Blazor web framework and .NET 9.
- The migration aims to preserve the native-like experience by transitioning directly from the desktop application to a Progressive Web Application (PWA), maintaining familiar user interactions and system integration capabilities.
- The shared components will be integrated into the new architecture to ensure a smooth transition and reuse existing business logic.

## Consequences

- Expected improved collaboration capabilities through a web-based application.
- Expected improved 'time to update' when releasing updates.
- Expected new deployment targets for migrated application, including tablets and mobile devices.
- Short-term increase in development workload due to the refactoring process but long-term benefits in maintainability.
- Utilization of existing team skills, minimizing the need for extensive retraining.
