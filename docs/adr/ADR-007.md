# Migration of Design Implementation from WPF to Blazor WebAssembly

## Status

Proposed

## Context

As part of migrating the AudiSense application from WPF to Blazor WebAssembly, the design implementation needs to transition from WPF's XAML style definitions to Blazor's CSS-based styling. This ADR documents the strategy for moving the existing, documented styling solutions to relevant global or component-scoped CSS in Blazor, focusing on simplicity and maintainability.

## Decision

### Simplified CSS Transition

1. **Native CSS Features**: Leverage native CSS capabilities (Selectors, Flexbox, Grid, etc.) to achieve layout and styling without introducing pre-processors during the initial migration.
   - **Global Styles**: Move broadly applicable styles to a global stylesheet (`site.css`) located in the `wwwroot/css` directory of the Blazor application.
   - **Component-Scoped Styles**: Define component-specific styles within `.razor.css` files, providing isolated styling scopes.
   
2. **CSS Properties (Variables)**:
   - Use CSS variables for theme and design consistency across components, creating a flexible and maintainable design system.
   - Define common theme properties (e.g., colors, fonts) in a dedicated CSS file.

3. **Exclusions**:
   - **No SCSS Usage**: Avoid using SCSS or other CSS pre-processors during the initial migration phase to reduce complexity.
   - Focus on implementing responsive design using CSS media queries where needed, instead of relying on SCSS nesting or mixins.

## Migration Strategy

1. **Identify Styling Elements in XAML**:
   - Catalog existing XAML resources, styles, and templates.
   - Translate these styles into equivalent CSS rules.

2. **Global vs. Component Scope**:
   - Move general-purpose styling to `wwwroot/css/site.css`.
   - Attach component-specific styles directly to components using Blazor's scoped stylesheets.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use CSS Flexbox and Grid for layouts requiring dynamic resizing and positioning.
   - Apply media queries for responsive adjustments without SCSS media function.

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Implement a testing process to verify that styles are applied consistently across the web application.
   - Use browser dev tools to ensure compatibility and consistency with existing WPF appearance.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Simplicity**: Reducing potential complexities by sticking to native CSS improves learning and transition ease.
- **Flexibility**: CSS properties allow for easy design adjustments and theming.
- **Maintainability**: Isolating styles to components reduces dependency entanglement.

### Drawbacks

- **Complex Styles**: More intricate styles might require creative CSS solutions without SCSS.
- **Manual Process**: The translation requires manual mapping of XAML to CSS, demanding attention to detail.
