# Performance Optimization and Bundle Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context

Migrating from native WPF to Blazor WebAssembly introduces significant performance challenges that can impact user adoption. Users expect desktop-class performance, but WebAssembly faces fundamental constraints:

**Core Performance Problems:**
- **Large Bundle Size**: WebAssembly applications require downloading the entire runtime and application code before execution
- **Cold Start Latency**: Network download and initialization time vs. instant desktop application launch
- **Memory Management Overhead**: Browser garbage collection patterns differ from native .NET
- **JavaScript Interop Cost**: UI updates require crossing the WebAssembly-JavaScript boundary

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Bundle size must be minimized for acceptable load times
- Critical path rendering must be optimized for perceived performance
- Memory usage patterns must be monitored and controlled
- Performance metrics must guide optimization decisions

## Decision

We will implement a **performance optimization strategy** focused on bundle size reduction, lazy loading, and performance monitoring.

### 1. Bundle Size Optimization

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <RunAOTCompilation>true</RunAOTCompilation>
  <PublishTrimmed>true</PublishTrimmed>
  <TrimMode>link</TrimMode>
  <CompressionEnabled>true</CompressionEnabled>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### 2. Lazy Loading

```csharp
// Component virtualization
<Virtualize Context="item" ItemsProvider="LoadItems">
    <ItemComponent Item="item" />
</Virtualize>

// Assembly lazy loading
var module = await ModuleLoader.LoadModuleAsync<IModule>();

// Resource lazy loading
<img loading="lazy" src="@ImageUrl" />
```

### 3. Memory Management

```csharp
public class DataComponent : ComponentBase, IAsyncDisposable
{
    private CancellationTokenSource _cts = new();
    
    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        _cts?.Cancel();
        _cts?.Dispose();
    }
}
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring

```csharp
// Track performance metrics
await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync("performance.mark", "page-start");
// ... page loading
await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync("performance.mark", "page-end");
```

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- **Improved Initial Load Time**: Bundle optimization and AOT compilation reduce startup latency by 40â€“60%
- **Better Runtime Performance**: Optimized memory management and lazy loading improve perceived performance
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Performance monitoring enables proactive optimization and issue detection
- **Competitive Desktop Performance**: Optimizations narrow the performance gap between native WPF and WebAssembly
- **Scalable Architecture**: Lazy loading and code splitting support future feature additions without performance degradation
- **Data-Driven Optimization**: Performance metrics provide objective feedback for continuous improvement

### Challenges and Mitigations

- **Increased Build Complexity**: AOT compilation and trimming add build time and complexity
  - *Mitigation*: Implement development vs. production build configurations with optimized CI/CD pipelines
- **Testing Requirements**: Trimming and AOT can introduce runtime failures not present in development
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive automated testing including performance regression tests
- **Memory Management Complexity**: Manual memory management patterns increase development overhead
  - *Mitigation*: Create reusable patterns, components, and developer guidelines
- **Performance Monitoring Overhead**: Tracking can impact performance if not implemented carefully
  - *Mitigation*: Implement sampling-based monitoring and disable in development builds

### Technical Considerations

- **Build Pipeline Changes**: CI/CD pipelines must accommodate longer AOT build times
- **CDN Configuration**: Asset caching and compression require proper CDN setup
- **Browser Compatibility**: Performance APIs may have different support across browsers
- **Deployment Size**: Initial deployment packages will be larger due to AOT compilation
- **Development Workflow**: Local development may differ from optimized production builds

### Performance Targets

- **Initial Load Time**: < 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Time to Interactive**: < 5 seconds for critical functionality
- **Bundle Size**: < 10MB total download (compressed)
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB heap usage for typical workflows
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60 FPS for animations and interactions

### Monitoring and Success Metrics

- **Core Web Vitals**: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s, First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
- **User-Centric Metrics**: Task completion time comparison with the original WPF application
- **Technical Metrics**: Bundle size, memory usage, CPU utilization patterns
- **Business Metrics**: User adoption rates, session duration, task completion rates
