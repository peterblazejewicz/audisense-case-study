# Progressive Web Application (PWA) Offline Support Implementation

## Status

osed

## Context

The migration from WPF desktop application to Blazor WebAssembly (ADR-001) requires maintaining the desktop experience of local availability and offline functionality. Desktop applications inherently work without network connectivity, storing data locally and synchronizing when services are available. This ADR defines the PWA implementation strategy to preserve this critical user experience.

## Decision

### PWA Offline Strategy

**Core Requirements:**
- Application shell and critical assets cached for offline access
- Local data persistence during network outages
- Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored
- Seamless transition between online/offline states

**Implementation Components:**

1. **Service Worker Registration**
   - Cache application shell, static assets, and API responses
   - Implement background sync for data synchronization
   - Handle network state changes and fallback strategies

2. **Local Storage Architecture**
   - Primary: IndexedDB for structured data and large datasets
   - Secondary: localStorage for simple key-value configuration
   - Session: sessionStorage for temporary UI state

3. **Data Synchronization Model**
   - Queue offline changes with timestamps
   - Implement conflict resolution strategies
   - Batch synchronization on network restoration

### Local Storage Options

**IndexedDB (Recommended):**
- ✅ Industry standard for Blazor WebAssembly applications
- ✅ Structured data storage with schema versioning
- ✅ Large storage capacity (typically 50MB+ per origin)
- ✅ Asynchronous operations with transaction support
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility
- ❌ Complex API requiring abstraction layer

**localStorage:**
- ✅ Simple key-value storage API
- ✅ Synchronous access for immediate data needs
- ✅ Persistent across browser sessions
- ❌ Limited storage capacity (5–10MB)
- ❌ String-only storage requiring serialization
- ❌ Synchronous operations can block UI

**sessionStorage:**
- ✅ Tab-specific temporary storage
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on tab closure
- ❌ Lost on browser restart
- ❌ Same capacity limitations as localStorage

### Security Considerations

**Data Protection:**
- Encrypt sensitive data before local storage
- Implement data expiration policies
- Clear storage on user logout
- Consider GDPR implications for personal data storage

**Storage Limitations:**
- Browser storage quotas vary by platform
- Private browsing modes may restrict storage
- Users can clear browser data manually
- Storage can be evicted under memory pressure

**Decision Against Storing Data Locally:**
- **Highly Sensitive Data**: Financial records, medical information, or classified data should not be stored locally
- **Compliance Requirements**: Regulations requiring server-side data control
- **Large Datasets**: Applications with extensive data requirements exceeding browser limits
- **Shared Devices**: Public or shared computer environments where data persistence is undesirable

## Consequences

### Benefits

**User Experience:**
- Maintains desktop-like always-available functionality
- Seamless offline operation preserving user productivity
- Faster application startup with cached resources
- Reduced dependency on network connectivity

**Technical Advantages:**
- Reduced server load through intelligent caching
- Improved application resilience and reliability
- Progressive enhancement supporting various network conditions
- Native mobile app-like behavior when installed

### Drawbacks

**Implementation Complexity:**
- Service Worker lifecycle management
- Data synchronization conflict resolution
- Cross-browser compatibility testing requirements
- Storage quota management and error handling

**Security and Privacy:**
- Local data vulnerable to device compromise
- Browser storage accessible to malicious scripts
- Data retention policies must be carefully managed
- Potential for data loss during browser maintenance

**Technical Limitations:**
- Storage quotas vary across browsers and devices
- IndexedDB complexity requires abstraction libraries
- Background sync limited by browser power management
- Offline detection reliability varies by platform

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Core PWA Setup**
- Service Worker registration and basic caching
- Offline page and network state detection
- Application shell caching strategy

**Phase 2: Data Persistence**
- IndexedDB integration with the abstraction layer
- Local data storage for critical user changes
- Conflict resolution framework implementation

**Phase 3: Synchronization**
- Background sync implementation
- Queue management for offline changes
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

**Prerequisites:**
- ADR-004 Blazor WebAssembly hosting model
- ADR-006 development environment setup
- HTTPS deployment requirement for Service Workers
