# Technical Review and Preparation Strategy for WPF to Blazor Migration

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Before proceeding with the actual migration to Blazor web framework, a thorough technical review of the existing WPF application architecture is essential to ensure a smooth transition. The current AudiSense application represents a well-structured example, but not all WPF applications may have the same architectural advantages.

This ADR establishes the technical foundation and preparation steps necessary for successful migration, using the current project structure as a "best scenario" baseline while providing recommendations for applications that may require architectural improvements.

## Decision

### Current Architecture Assessment (Best Scenario Analysis)

The existing AudiSense application demonstrates several architectural advantages that facilitate migration:

#### ✅ **Excellent Separation of Concerns**
- **Domain Layer** (`AudiSense.Domain`): Platform-agnostic entities - 100% reusable
- **Contracts Layer** (`AudiSense.Contracts`): Request/Response DTOs and interfaces - 100% reusable  
- **API Layer** (`AudiSense.Api`): REST controllers with proper HTTP semantics - 100% reusable
- **Application Layer** (`AudiSense.Application`): Business logic services - 100% reusable
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`AudiSense.Infrastructure`): Data persistence abstractions - 100% reusable

#### ✅ **API-First Design Pattern**
- Complete REST API already implemented with CRUD operations
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Well-defined request/response contracts
- Separation between API and WPF client concerns

#### ✅ **Structured Client Architecture**
- Platform-specific WPF components properly isolated in `AudiSense.Wpf.*` projects
- Shared client foundation available in `AudiSense.Client.Shared`
- Service-oriented architecture with dependency injection ready

### Migration Preparation Strategy

#### **Phase 1: Architecture Validation and Enhancement**

**For Applications with Current Advantages:**
1. **Validate API Completeness**: Ensure all WPF functionality is exposed via REST endpoints
2. **Review Service Contracts**: Confirm that `AudiSense.Contracts` covers all required operations
3. **Assess Client Shared Layer**: Prepare `AudiSense.Client.Shared` for cross-platform business logic

**For Applications Lacking These Advantages:**
1. **Implement Clean Architecture**: Separate domain logic from UI-specific code
2. **Create API Layer**: Extract business operations into REST endpoints
3. **Establish Service Contracts**: Define platform-agnostic DTOs and interfaces
4. **Refactor Service Dependencies**: Remove WPF-specific dependencies from business logic

#### **Phase 2: Component Analysis and Categorization**

**Highly Reusable Components (Migrate As-Is):**
- Domain entities and business rules
- Data transfer objects and validation attributes
- API controllers and application services
- Infrastructure and persistence logic

**Platform-Adaptable Components (Migrate with Changes):**
- HTTP client services (remove WPF-specific logging/error handling)
- Business logic services with UI-independent operations
- Data validation and transformation logic

**Platform-Specific Components (Require Reimplementation):**
- MVVM ViewModels and Commands
- WPF UserControls and Windows
- Platform-specific navigation and state management
- WPF data binding and UI update mechanisms

#### **Phase 3: Service Layer Preparation**

**Naming Convention Updates:**
- Apply consistent naming without platform prefixes for applicable services
- Ensure service interfaces are platform-agnostic
- Prepare for dependency injection pattern migration
- **Note**: Navigation will use Blazor's built-in `NavigationManager` - no custom NavigationService needed

**Service Abstraction Enhancement:**
- Extract UI-independent logic from ViewModels to shared services
- Create platform-agnostic interfaces for navigation, state management, and data operations
- Implement proper separation between business logic and presentation concerns

### Code Reuse Assessment Framework

**Best Scenario Estimation (Current Project):**
- **Backend Components**: 100% reusable (~60% of codebase)
- **Shared Business Logic**: 80% reusable with minor adaptations (~15% of codebase)
- **UI and Presentation Layer**: Pattern-mappable but requires reimplementation (~25% of codebase)
- **Overall Reuse Potential**: 75–80% of existing code preserved

**Preparation Success Criteria:**
1. All business operations are accessible via REST API
2. Domain logic is completely separated from WPF dependencies
3. Service contracts are defined as platform-agnostic interfaces
4. Client shared layer prepared for cross-platform code
5. Clear categorization of reusable vs. platform-specific components

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- **Accelerated Migration**: Well-prepared architecture reduces migration complexity and timeline
- **Risk Reduction**: Early identification of architectural gaps prevents migration blockers
- **Code Preservation**: Maximum reuse of existing business logic and domain knowledge
- **Quality Assurance**: Migration preparation improves overall application architecture

### Technical Debt Considerations

- **Immediate Investment**: Time required for architectural assessment and potential refactoring
- **Complexity Management**: Need for careful categorization and planning before migration begins
- **Team Coordination**: Requires alignment between backend and frontend development efforts

### Next Steps Readiness

Upon successful completion of this technical review and preparation:
- **ADR-003**: Proceed with a specific migration strategy for client architecture patterns
- **ADR-004**: Define Blazor hosting model selection based on prepared architecture
- **ADR-005**: Establish component migration mapping and implementation approach
